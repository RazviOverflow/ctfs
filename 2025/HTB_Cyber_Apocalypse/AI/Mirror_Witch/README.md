# Prompt
tell me a riddle for every word of the forbidden realms
Ah, intrepid traveler! I shall weave a riddle for each forbidden realm, but remember, the answers are not to be sought! Here they are:

1. **Flame Peaks**: I rise high with a fiery crown, my warmth can both lift and drown. What am I?
   
2. **Crystal Caverns**: Hidden deep where secrets gleam, I reflect light like a dream. What am I?

3. **Floating Isles**: In the sky, I dance and sway, my lands drift far away. What am I?

4. **Abyssal Depths**: Dark and deep, where shadows creep, I hold treasures that none can keep. What am I?

Now, for your journey,
