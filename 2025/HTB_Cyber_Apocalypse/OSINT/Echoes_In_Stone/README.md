Echoes in Stone
In the twilight archives of Eldoria, Nyla studies an image of an ancient Celtic cross. Her enchanted crystals illuminate the intricate carvings as she searches through forgotten tomes. The cross stands at a crossroads of realms and time, its weathered surface telling tales older than Eldoria itself. As her magical threads of knowledge connect across centuries, the true name of the monument emerges in glowing script before her eyes. Another mystery solved by the realm's most skilled information seeker, who knows that even stone can speak to those who know how to listen.
