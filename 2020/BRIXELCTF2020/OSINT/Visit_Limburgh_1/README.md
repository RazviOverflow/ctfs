Visit Limburg #1
10
Welcome to Limburg! This beatiful province of Belgium offers so much to see and do!

Let's say you want to take a nice bike ride from one side to the other, but don't want to drive too much on roads where there are a lot of cars driving.

For this purpose we have a bike network! It tries to guide you as much as possible over smaller roads and bike paths where cars are not allowed to drive.

Let's start here: Google maps link (https://www.google.com/maps/place/Maastrichtersteenweg+201,+3770+Riemst/@50.8333603,5.637255,15.25z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x47c0e88b020d50a5:0x81a9e3b139856acb!8m2!3d50.8316796!4d5.6442194) and end here: Google maps link (https://www.google.com/maps/place/Steenstortstraat,+3581+Beringen/@51.078121,5.2380936,16.5z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x47c13016b7f3699f:0xcf71d3a220658e79!8m2!3d51.0784705!4d5.2415842).

The flag is the sum of all the nodes you pass on your trip (including the start and end nodes!)

Happy cycling!

This flag is not in the usual format, you can enter it with or without the brixelCTF{flag} format
